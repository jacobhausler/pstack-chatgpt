### Feature

**You own the design. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate implementation. Stay in the lead.

1. `how` over the affected subsystem.
2. `architect` for parallel design exploration.
3. Write the throughput checkpoint as four todo items. A dimension that genuinely does not apply (single file, no fan-out) keeps its item with `n/a: <reason>` rather than being dropped:
   - **Blocking first steps.** Gates run before fan-out.
   - **Independent workstreams.** Disjoint files, services, or layers parallelize. Shared writes serialize.
   - **Shared mutable state.** Default to splitting the target (the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill). Serialize only for real invariants.
   - **Smallest safe decomposition.** If one worker is best, name why.
4. Delegate code-writing only when the user authorized delegation or the active workflow requires it. Read **delegate-work**, use exposed native subagent tools, and inherit the parent model and effort unless supported configured overrides apply. Give the worker a specific scope (file paths, named data shape and its organizing structure per **principle-model-the-domain**, a state machine over scattered booleans, a table/registry over branching, a typed model over repeated shape assumptions, chosen before the delegate writes logic, and success criteria). When the implementation admits multiple valid shapes, compare the alternatives with the native **arena** workflow when available; otherwise prototype or analyze them directly. Delegation is optional when unavailable or unauthorized. Keep review separation where feasible, but do not invent a spawn requirement. Do not leave the task in a waiting state without reporting the actual blocker and next step. Comments per **Comments**. Surgical edits, re-ground against the source for upstream-derived files. Port shared-primitive improvements to all consumers and verify each. Commit only when authorized.
5. Verify on the matching surface. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
6. Rebase into small, ordered commits. Stack follow-ups.
   Use the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, building, verifying, and committing each small unit before the next.
7. If the design is contested, `interrogate` before shipping.
8. Run **Opening a PR**.

Code-coupled work (one feature, one migration) goes to a single owner with the checkpoint inline. That owner fans out internally after the blocking phase. Parent-level fan-out is for slices that produce independent artifacts (audits, cross-subsystem investigations, competing experiments). Rewrite the checkpoint at phase boundaries. Spawn a fresh owner rather than chaining interrupts.

**Reply:** what you built, what you chose and why, the throughput checkpoint, open decisions. Tables for design alternatives.
